# ActuarialTools
Actuarial tools developed by Joseph Roth (KingdokRagnarok).

This repository is a place for me to write scripts and applications to broaden my knowledge of actuarial science, and to demonstrate my capabilities as an actuarial programmer.

At some point, I would like to develop these into tools for other actuaries to use. However, they are not at this time sufficiently developed for that purpose. If and when these tools are developed to a degree that they are useable for actuarial work, I will update this Readme to indicate such useability.

As of the current date, my objective is to replicate some of the tools on the SOA website (https://www.soa.org/resources/tables-calcs-tools/act-practice-tools-landing/). I have significant experience in developing pension-related models and applications, and I hope to learn about other actuarial areas of practice by replicating tools used in those areas.
